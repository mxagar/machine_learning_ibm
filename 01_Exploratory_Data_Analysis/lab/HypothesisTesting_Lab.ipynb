Alternative hypothesis is the opposite of null hypothesis. It assumes that the difference in observations is the result of a real effect. The alternate hypothesis is denoted by H1.\n"

    "To set the criteria for a decision, we state the level of significance for a test. It could be 5%, 1% or 0.5%. Based on the level of significance, we can make a decision whether to accept the null hypothesis and reject the alternate, and vise versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram above describes the principles of hypothesis testing. We will choose 5% significance level. Therefore, our $ \\alpha=0.05 $. Since we have a 2-tailed test, we have to divide alpha by 2, which gives us 0.025. So, if the calculated p-value is less than alpha, we will reject the null hypothesis. The significance level is based on the business requirements. If you would like to learn more about the statistical significance, please visit this [wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0232ENSkillsNetwork30654641-2022-01-01).\n",

    "A t-test is used for testing the mean of one population against a standard or comparing the means of two populations if you do not know standard deviation of the the population and when you have a limited sample (n < 30). If you know the standard deviation of the populations , you may use a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-test is used for testing the mean of a population versus a standard, or comparing the means of two populations, with large (n ≥ 30) samples, whether you know the population standard deviation or not. It is also used for testing the proportion of some characteristic versus a standard proportion, or comparing the proportions of two populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "An f-test is used to compare variances between 2 populations. The samples can be any size. It is the basis of ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the expected and the observed frequencies in one or more categories of a contingency table. A contingency table is a tabular representation of categorical data. It shows the frequency distribution of the variables.\n",
