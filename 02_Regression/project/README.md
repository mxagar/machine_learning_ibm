# IBM Machine Learning Certificate: Regression Project

We need to choose a data set in which we apply regression and write a report (a PDF) describing the data analysis and the insights. Submitting the code is optional.

Requirements:

- Describe the data.
- Main objective of the analysis; focus on prediction or interpretation?
- Summary of data exploration, data cleaning, feature engineering.
- At least 3 variations of linear regression, best chosen in terms of accuracy/explainability.
	- Use polynomial features.
	- Train/Test split and cross-validation.
- Key findings.
- Highlight possible flaws and plan of action to revisit analysis with different techniques; maybe add more features?

I decided to modify my [airbnb_data_analysis](https://github.com/mxagar/airbnb_data_analysis) to meet the requirements.
