# Tensorflow/Keras Guide

This folder contains two practical guides:

- [`05_Deep_Learning.md`](05_Deep_Learning.md): 
- [`DL_Keras_Guide.md`](DL_Keras_Guide.md): 

Additionally, I have added

- explanatory figures: [`pics`](pics),
- and code & notebooks used in the guides: [`lab`](lab).

I you're interested in more details on Deep Learning, I suggest you to visit my repository [deep_learning_udacity](https://github.com/mxagar/deep_learning_udacity).
