# Tensorflow/Keras Guide

This folder contains the course guide [`05_Deep_Learning.md`](05_Deep_Learning.md).

However, note that, in contrast to other courses in the IBM ML Specialization I have taken very few notes, because I have experience with Deep Learning in general.

Most importantly, **I have created a Keras guide which can be found in another repository of mine: [`DL_Keras_Guide.md`](https://github.com/mxagar/deep_learning_udacity/blob/main/02_Keras_Guide/DL_Keras_Guide.md). That guide is more interesting than the notes here,l assuming you know how Deep Learning works**. I you're interested in more details on Deep Learning, I suggest you to visit one of my following repositories:

- [deep_learning_udacity](https://github.com/mxagar/deep_learning_udacity): deep dive into the topic using Pytorch.
- [machine_learning_coursera](https://github.com/mxagar/machine_learning_coursera): theoretical background using Octave/Matlab.

Finally, note that, nonetheless, I have collected interesting

- explanatory figures: [`pics`](pics),
- and code & notebooks used in the course: [`lab`](lab).
