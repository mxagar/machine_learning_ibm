# Tensorflow/Keras Guide

This file contains a guide to the Keras/Tensorflow 2.0 framework.

I assembled the first version of this guide based on the material of these courses:

- [Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning, IBM / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-reinforcement-learning?specialization=ibm-machine-learning)
- [Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp, J. M. Portilla / Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/)
- [Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning, J. M. Portilla / Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/)
