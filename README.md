# IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate

These are my notes and the code of the [IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning) offered by IBM & Coursera.

The Specialization is divided in 6 courses, and each of them has its own folder with its guide & notebooks:

1. [Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-exploratory-data-analysis-for-machine-learning?specialization=ibm-machine-learning)
2. [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-regression?specialization=ibm-machine-learning)
3. [Supervised Machine Learning: Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-classification?specialization=ibm-machine-learning)
4. [Unsupervised Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-unsupervised-machine-learning?specialization=ibm-machine-learning)
5. [Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-reinforcement-learning?specialization=ibm-machine-learning)
6. [Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/time-series-survival-analysis?specialization=ibm-machine-learning)

**To use these notes, just go to the topic folder and follow the Markdown file in there.** Each topic folder contains a `lab/` directory with example/exercise notebooks.
